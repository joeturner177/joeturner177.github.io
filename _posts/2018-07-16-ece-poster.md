Earlier this month several other members of the Darby Lab and I
travelled to Naples to attend the [XI European Congress of
Entomology](http://www.ece2018.com/).

In addition to hearing some fascinating talks on a variety of insect-y
subjects, I presented my PhD research on the _Aedes aegypti_
sex-determining locus in the evolutionary genomics poster session.

A number of people asked for a photo/digital copy of my poster so I
thought I would make it available here on the website. A preprint of the
article on which it is based is also available on _bioRxiv_
[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/28/122804).
