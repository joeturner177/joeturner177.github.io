The paper describing the new high quality reference genome assembly for the mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_, AaegL5, is now published in _Nature_.

This marks the culmination of a huge international collaboration called the _Aedes_ Genome
Working Group (AGWG), originally set up by Ben Matthews and Leslie Vosshall at Rockefeller
University in New York. A total of 72 authors brought diverse skills to assemble and
analyse the most complete genome yet for this insect, with 94% of the assembled sequence
present on three chromosome-length scaffolds. The genome has already become a valuable
resource for the mosquito community, and the data is [available on
VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/aedes-aegypti/lvp_agwg) (including the
new gene set consolidated with previous versions).

My contribution to the AGWG was as part of the team investigating the sex-determining M
locus. Nearly the entire M locus is present in the new assembly, allowing its full
sequence to be studied for the first time. I helped to analyse sex-specific coverage over
the M locus and surrounding region, and provided the male-biased BACs that were
sequenced for [my previous M locus study](https://joeturner.eu/posts/Nix-paper.html) to
the Sharakhova lab at Virginia Tech to act as probes for fluorescent _in situ_
hybridisation (FISH), allowing the physical location of the M locus to be placed on
chromosome 1.

The _Nature_ News and Views section has an excellent summary of the findings of the paper
and their significance: [Improved mosquito genome points to population-control

> ### Abstract
> 
> Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infect more than 400 million people each year with
> dangerous viral pathogens including dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya.
> Progress in understanding the biology of mosquitoes and developing the tools to
> fight them has been slowed by the lack of a high-quality genome assembly. Here we
> combine diverse technologies to produce the markedly improved, fully re-annotated
> AaegL5 genome assembly, and demonstrate how it accelerates mosquito science. We
> anchored physical and cytogenetic maps, doubled the number of known chemosensory
> ionotropic receptors that guide mosquitoes to human hosts and egg-laying sites,
> provided further insight into the size and composition of the sex-determining M
> locus, and revealed copy-number variation among glutathione S-transferase genes
> that are important for insecticide resistance. Using high-resolution quantitative
> trait locus and population genomic analyses, we mapped new candidates for dengue
> vector competence and insecticide resistance. AaegL5 will catalyse new biological
> insights and intervention strategies to fight this deadly disease vector.
