The paper based on my masters research, supervised by Bill Hughes at the University of Sussex, is now published in _Behavioural Processes_. 

[The effect of parasitism on personality in a social insect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635717303200)

In this study, we used behavioural assays to determine that individual
wood ants consistently differ from one another in a number of
"personality" traits. We exposed the ants to a lethal fungal parasite of
insects, and found that parasitism did not significantly alter the
personalities of individual ants.

More details can be found in the abstract below.

> ##Abstract
> Individuals are known to differ consistently in various aspects of their
> behaviour in many animal species, a phenomenon that has come to be
> referred to as animal personalities. These individual differences are
> likely to have evolutionary and ecological significance, and it is
> therefore important to understand the precise nature of how
> environmental and physiological factors affect animal personalities. One
> factor which may affect personality is disease, but while the effects of
> disease on many aspects of host behaviour are well known, the effects on
> animal personalities have been little studied. Here we show that wood
> ants, Formica rufa, exhibit consistent individual differences in three
> personality traits: boldness, sociability and aggressiveness. However,
> experimental exposure to a virulent fungal parasite, Metarhizium
> pingshaense, had surprisingly little effect on the personality traits.
> Parasite-challenged ants showed marginal changes in sociability at high
> doses of parasite but no change in boldness or aggressiveness even when
> close to death. There was similarly little effect of other physiological
> stresses on ant personalities. The results suggest that individual
> personality in ants can be remarkably resilient to physiological stress,
> such as that caused by parasite infection. Future studies are needed to
> determine whether there is a similar resilience in solitary animals, as
> well as in other social species.
