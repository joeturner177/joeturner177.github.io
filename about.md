I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Betancourt Lab](https://www.flyevolution.net/) in the Department of Evolution, Ecology and Behaviour, 
Institute of Integrative Biology at the University of Liverpool.

### Research Interests

My research examines the evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements in
the model fly _Drosophila_. I am interested in using genomics to
understand how these mobile genetic elements launch successful invasions
into host populations, and how their hosts evolve in response.

### Academic background

I gained my BA in Biological Sciences at the University in Oxford in
2011, where I developed a strong interest in evolutionary biology and
entomology. I conducted my honours research project on spider
behavioural ecology in the Oxford Silk Group in the Department of
Zoology.

After working for around 18 months as a teacher, I undertook an MPhil in
the Hughes Lab in the School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex. My
project investigated the effects of parasites on the behaviour of social
insects, and furthered my interest in the ecological and evolutionary
interactions between parasites, symbionts and insect hosts.

After this, I began my PhD at Liverpool and made the switch to genomics,
which fostered an increasing interest in bioinformatics and computational
biology. My PhD research focused on the genetics of mosquito sex
determination, using bioinformatic and synthetic biology approaches to
understand the structure and content of the _Aedes aegypti_ Y
chromosome-like sex-determining region known as the M locus. The ultimate
aim of the project was to gain an understanding of which genes are
responsible for determining whether _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes become male
or female, and what other genomic features are involved in maintaining
sex-specific chromosomal regions. In addition to being interesting from an
evolutionary point of view, this could potentially be applied to existing
and novel control strategies targeting this important arbovirus vector (for
instance, enhancing genetic control techniques by facilitating sex-specific
effects).

### Other interests

As a scientist, I am committed to pursuing responsible science and using
science and technology to contribute towards creating a sustainable,
peaceful, and just society. I am interested in promoting gender
equality, nuclear disarmament, and encouraging the scientific community
to end support for arms manufacturers and polluting industries. As a
non-specialist, I also have a strong interest in a number of social and
political issues including migrant and refugee solidarity, antiracist
and antifascist activities, and homelessness support.
